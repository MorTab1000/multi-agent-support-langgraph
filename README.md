# Multi-Agent Academic Assistant - AWS Cloud Integration (LangGraph)

🟢 Interactive Architecture Walkthrough: [Live Demo](https://mortab1000.github.io/multi-agent-support-langgraph/) - Click to see the step-by-step data flow.

A production-ready multi-agent pipeline that answers Machine Learning Introduction course questions using LangGraph, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Comprehend, and SageMaker A2I.

Built as a hands-on workshop lab demonstrating real-world multi-agent architecture on AWS.

## Architecture & Integration Flow

```text
POST /ask → Domain Classifier (api.py) → LangGraph Graph
                                              ├── KB Agent (Bedrock Knowledge Base)
                                              ├── Sentiment Agent (Amazon Comprehend)
                                              └── Join → Confidence Router
                                                              ├── ≥ 0.7 → LLM Generator (Nova Pro + Guardrail v4)
                                                              └── < 0.7  → Human Escalation (SageMaker A2I)
```

### Key Cloud & Infrastructure Integrations:

- **Serverless Deployment:** The LangGraph API is containerized using Docker and deployed securely on AWS App Runner.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Integrated SageMaker A2I to catch low-confidence LLM outputs and route them to human reviewers.
- **Automated Feedback Loop:** Configured an event-driven architecture using EventBridge and Lambda (`a2i_completion_handler.py`). When a human answers an escalated ticket, the system automatically writes it back to S3 and triggers a Bedrock Knowledge Base sync to improve future answers.
- **LLM is skipped entirely** when the KB has no relevant answer (prevents hallucination)
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Utilized CloudFormation templates for provisioning S3 buckets, IAM roles, ECR, and Lambda.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with permissions for Bedrock, S3, IAM, ECR, App Runner, Comprehend, SageMaker
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure` or named profile)
- Docker (for App Runner deployment)
- Python 3.12+

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Deploy

The deployment process is automated via bash scripts that handle CloudFormation execution, Docker image building, ECR pushing, and App Runner deployment.

```bash
# Full automated deployment (CloudFormation → KB → Guardrail → Docker → ECR → App Runner)
bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

The script will print the live App Runner URL when complete.

### 3. Test the API

```bash
curl -s -X POST <YOUR_APP_RUNNER_URL>/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What is overfitting in machine learning?"}' | jq
```

### 4. Tear down infrastructure

```bash
bash scripts/destroy.sh
```

## MCP Integration

The project now supports Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI agents (like Claude or Cursor) to directly query the AWS Knowledge Base as a tool.

## Streamlit Chat UI

You can run a modern chat frontend locally that calls the deployed `/ask` endpoint.

Live Streamlit deployment:
[see demo app](https://multi-agent-support-langgraph-tfubxmftwqzhju8xg77t8f.streamlit.app/)

### Configure API URL

To connect the UI to your backend API, you need to set the `SUPPORT_API_URL` environment variable.

**For Local Development:**
Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and set your deployed App Runner URL:

```bash
SUPPORT_API_URL=https://46r8ga4hcc.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/ask
```

**For Cloud Deployment:**
If deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud (like the live demo), set this URL securely via Streamlit Secrets in the app's advanced settings.

### Run

```bash
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
```

Features included:

- Chat-style interface with message history via `st.session_state`
- Custom assistant icons: Robot (`🤖`) for AI and Teacher (`🧑‍🏫`) for escalated responses
- Escalation indicator box when API returns `escalated: true`
- Confidence score caption for each assistant response
- Robust network/HTTP/JSON error handling
- LaTeX formula rendering in responses through Streamlit Markdown (`$...$`, `$$...$$`)

## Project Evolution & My Contributions

This project originated from a foundational LangGraph & AWS workshop. However, it has been significantly expanded, refactored, and transformed into a full-stack, production-ready application. 

**Key enhancements and custom implementations include:**

   - **Domain Shift & Real-World Use Case:** Adapted the base logic to function as an Academic Assistant, processing real-world university lecture slides and materials.
   - **Full-Stack UI:** Developed and integrated a persistent, user-friendly Streamlit frontend.
   - **MCP Server Integration:** Engineered a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, allowing external AI agents (like Claude Desktop or Cursor) to query the AWS Knowledge Base directly.
   - **Cloud Infrastructure & CI/CD:** Architected the complete serverless deployment (App Runner, EventBridge, Lambda, SageMaker A2I) and wrote the automated bash deployment/teardown scripts.


## 🚀 Future Roadmap
While the current architecture is fully functional, several enhancements are planned to scale the system's reasoning capabilities and simplify the infrastructure:

* **Model Migration:** Transitioning the core LLM generator from Amazon Nova Pro to the **Claude 3.5 family**. This migration aims to reduce prompt-engineering overhead and significantly improve the system's ability to follow complex, multi-step instructions.
* **Agentic Query Routing:** Implementing a **Query Planner** node within the LangGraph architecture. This will enable the decomposition of complex, multi-hop queries, allowing the agents to synthesize answers across multiple disparate documents.
* **Session Persistence:** Upgrading the Streamlit frontend to support long-term memory and multiple chat threads, potentially utilizing Amazon DynamoDB to persist `thread_id` states securely.
